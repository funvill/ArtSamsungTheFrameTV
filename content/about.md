## FAQ

### How to load artwork onto the Samsung 'The Frame' TV?

Sumsung don't make it easy but there are some good video instructions that I have tested.

Note: All images are sized 3840 x 2160. You do not need to resize the image.

### How did you make these images?

This work was generated using AI/ML with <a href='https://www.midjourney.com/'>Mid Journey</a>

### Why are the images all the resolution of 3840×2160 (16:9-ish)

3840×2160 is a [16:9 aspect ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16:9_aspect_ratio). The 16:9 aspect ratio is a very common widescreen aspect ratio used in [4K UHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution#4K_UHD)

The Samsung 'The Frame' TV requires this exact resolution or it puts a 'mat border' around the artwork.
